# Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week marked the initial creation and implementation of the CryptoScore plugin for ElizaOS. The foundational work established the plugin's core capabilities, enabling it to retrieve token and wallet scores by integrating with the CryptoScore API. This initial version lays the groundwork for providing valuable on-chain data and insights directly within the ElizaOS agent framework.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The focus this week was entirely on establishing the plugin's initial structure and core features.

### Initial Plugin Implementation
The project was kickstarted with the first implementation of the CryptoScore plugin, introducing its primary functions. This work, captured in PR [#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/1), allows the plugin to:
- Retrieve token scores using either a contract address or a symbol.
- Analyze and return wallet scores.

To support this, essential services like `cryptoScoreService.ts` were created to handle interactions with the external CryptoScore API. Additionally, helper utilities and response templates were put in place to structure data and format responses.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
