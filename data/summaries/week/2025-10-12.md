# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week marked a major milestone for the ElizaOS project with the successful launch of our frontend application's foundational architecture. We went from a blank slate to a functional starting point, establishing the core structure and building the initial user-facing components that will allow users to interact with our AI agents. This foundational work paves the way for rapid feature development and brings our vision for an interactive AI framework closer to reality.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Building the User Interface for Our AI Agents**
This initiative is critical for turning our powerful backend AI capabilities into a tangible and interactive experience for users.

-   The foundational structure for the new web application was established, creating a solid base for all future development in [Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend).
-   Initial connections to our backend Eliza API were integrated, enabling the user interface to communicate with our core AI systems ([Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend)).
-   The first set of core components for agent and chat interactions were built, providing the initial building blocks for the primary user experience ([Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend)).

## Repository Spotlights

### Sendo-labs/frontend
The focus this week was exclusively on bootstrapping the new frontend application from the ground up. This foundational effort prepares the repository for building out the full user experience.

-   Established the complete foundational architecture for the new user interface in a single, comprehensive effort ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)). This work included scaffolding the project, integrating API clients for backend communication, and implementing the first core UI components (`AgentSidebar.jsx`, `ChatInterface.jsx`) and state management hooks for agent and chat interactions.
