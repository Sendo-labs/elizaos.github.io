# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, we took a significant step in expanding our agent capabilities into the Web3 ecosystem. We launched the foundational version of the CryptoScore plugin, enabling ElizaOS agents to access and analyze on-chain reputation data for the first time.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Integrating On-Chain Intelligence into ElizaOS**
Our vision for autonomous agents requires them to operate intelligently in decentralized environments; this means giving them the tools to understand and evaluate on-chain assets and actors.
- The initial version of a new CryptoScore plugin was developed, providing agents with the ability to retrieve reputation scores for crypto tokens and wallets. This foundational work was completed in [Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore).

## Repository Spotlights

### Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore
The focus this week was on the initial creation of the plugin, laying the groundwork for bringing on-chain data into the ElizaOS framework.
- The first implementation of the CryptoScore plugin was completed ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/1)), establishing its core functionality.
- This initial version allows agents to retrieve token scores (by symbol or contract address) and wallet scores by integrating with the external CryptoScore API.
