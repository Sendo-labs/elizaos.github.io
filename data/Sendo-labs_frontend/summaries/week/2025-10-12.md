# Sendo-labs/frontend Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development was centered on establishing the foundational architecture for the new frontend application. A significant initial push saw the project scaffolded with essential configurations, development guides, and critical dependencies for the Eliza API. This foundational work culminated in the implementation of core UI components and state management hooks for agent and chat interactions, effectively laying the groundwork for the entire AI agent interface. The focus was purely on this initial setup, preparing the project for future feature development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
All development this week was consolidated into a single, comprehensive effort to bootstrap the application.

### **Initial Project Scaffolding and Core Feature Implementation**
The primary goal was to create a functional starting point for the frontend. This involved setting up the project structure, integrating with the backend API, and building the first set of user-facing components.

- **Project Setup & API Integration:** The initial project structure was established, including an `.env.example` for environment configuration and `CLAUDE.md` for development guidelines. The `package.json` was updated to include Eliza API dependencies, and the core API clients (`elizaClient.js`, `base44Client.js`) were created to handle communication with the backend.
- **UI Components & State Management:** To support AI agent interactions, new React hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) were developed for managing agent and chat state. Corresponding UI components, such as `AgentSidebar.jsx` and `ChatInterface.jsx`, were built to provide the user interface for these features. Supporting components like `AnimatedMarkdown.jsx` and page layouts were also implemented to create a cohesive user experience. All of this work was introduced in PR [#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2).
