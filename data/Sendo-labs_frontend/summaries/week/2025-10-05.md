# Sendo-labs/frontend Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked the inception of the Sendo-labs/frontend project. The foundational codebase was established in a single, comprehensive initial commit, laying the groundwork for the entire application. This first step introduced the core project structure, initial API client setups, and an extensive library of UI components. The work sets a clear direction for a component-driven development approach and prepares the project for future feature implementation and backend integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Activity this week was centered entirely on establishing the project's foundation.

### Project Initialization and Foundational Codebase
The repository was brought to life with its initial commit, which established the complete starting structure for the frontend application. This foundational work, captured in PR [#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1), included:
*   **Core Structure:** The initial set of configuration and core application files were committed.
*   **API Integration:** Stubs for API clients, including `base44Client.js`, `entities.js`, and `integrations.js`, were created to prepare for future backend communication.
*   **UI Component Library:** A vast collection of UI components was added, covering agent management (`agent-card.jsx`, `agent-creator.jsx`), marketplace features (`AgentCard.jsx`), and general UI elements (`accordion.jsx`, `alert-dialog.jsx`), indicating a strong focus on modularity from the outset.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
As the project was just initialized this week, there was no activity related to issues.
*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed.
*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there are no active issues at this time.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's development was focused on the singular act of the initial project commit. As the repository was just created, community discussion and collaborative activities have not yet commenced.
