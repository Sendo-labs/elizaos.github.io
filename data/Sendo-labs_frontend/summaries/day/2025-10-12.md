# Sendo-labs/frontend Daily Update (Oct 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today marked a significant step with the initial project setup for the frontend, integrating Eliza API dependencies and developing core UI components for agent and chat management. This lays the groundwork for future AI agent interactions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Initial Project Setup and Eliza Integration
- The project's foundational structure was established, including an `.env.example` for configuration and `CLAUDE.md` for development guidance.
- `package.json` was updated to incorporate Eliza API dependencies, crucial for AI agent functionality.
- Core Eliza API client (`src/lib/elizaClient.js`) and base API client (`src/api/base44Client.js`) were introduced. ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2))

### Agent and Chat Management Hooks & UI
- New hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) were developed to manage Eliza agent and chat interactions.
- Essential UI components for agent interaction (`AgentSidebar.jsx`, `ChatInterface.jsx`) and general UI elements (`AnimatedMarkdown.jsx`, `Markdown.jsx`, `Tool.jsx`) were created.
- Initial page layouts (`Agent.jsx`, `Layout.jsx`) were implemented to support the new components. ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2))
