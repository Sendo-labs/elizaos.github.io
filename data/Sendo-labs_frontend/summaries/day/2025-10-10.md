# Sendo-labs/frontend Daily Update (Oct 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The Sendo-labs/frontend repository saw its initial commit today, establishing the foundational codebase for the project. This significant first step includes a wide array of components and API structures, setting the stage for future development.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Project Initialization and Core Structure
The repository was initialized with a comprehensive set of files, including configuration, core application files, and a substantial collection of UI components. This initial commit lays the groundwork for the entire frontend application. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1))

### API Integration Setup
Initial API client structures for `base44Client.js`, `entities.js`, and `integrations.js` were included, indicating early planning for backend communication and data handling. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1))

### Extensive UI Component Library
A large number of UI components were added, covering various aspects of the application from agent management (`agent-card.jsx`, `agent-creator.jsx`) to marketplace features (`AgentCard.jsx`, `CategorySection.jsx`) and general UI elements (`accordion.jsx`, `alert-dialog.jsx`). This suggests a component-driven development approach from the outset. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1))
